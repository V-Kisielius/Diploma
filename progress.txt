Problem 1:
    bound integral and f_abs_integral are zeros

Goals:
2. 4d approach with appending the time dimension
3. Check data_3d for correctness
5. Including BOUND_THRASHOLD in the model. In forward or in train? How do i need to change a loss? Mb minimizing the 'bad' pixels number?
7. Searching for the optimum radius - night tests
8. Appending loss computation to researching of range
9. How to plot f(x, y)?
10. Dropouts in the model
11. 2d plot  for opt radius. x = radius, y = img shape, color = min_distance

Questions:
1. Find out about itemizing the markdown cells
6. Use masking in dataset for loss computation. Masks vs. np.where
4. Think about powers of f in integrals. Why in bound integral we use .pow(2)?
