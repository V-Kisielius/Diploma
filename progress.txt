Problem 1:
    bound integral and f_abs_integral are zeros

Goals:
1. Find out about itemizing the markdown cells
2. 4d approach with appending the time dimension
3. Check data_3d for correctness
4. Think about powers of f in integrals. Why in bound integral we use .pow(2)?
5. Including BOUND_THRASHOLD in the model. In forward or in train? How do i need to change a loss? Mb minimizing the 'bad' pixels number?
6. Use masking in dataset for loss computation. Masks vs. np.where
7. Searching for the optimum radius
8. Appending loss computation to researching of range
